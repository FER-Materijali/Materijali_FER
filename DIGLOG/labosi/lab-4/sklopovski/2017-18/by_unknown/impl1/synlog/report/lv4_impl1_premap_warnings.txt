@W: MT529 :"d:\ivan\faks\1. semestar\diglog\lv4\impl1\source\upravljac.vhd":29:1:29:2|Found inferred clock datapath|clk_25m which controls 43 sequential elements including I_upravljac.R_debounce_cnt[31:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
