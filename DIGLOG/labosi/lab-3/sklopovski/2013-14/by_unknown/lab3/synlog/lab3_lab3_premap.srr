@W: MT529 :"c:\users\dr.chernobyl\desktop\lab3\lab3\source\fmgen.vhd":200:1:200:2|Found inferred clock pll_250m|CLKOP_inferred_clock which controls 116 sequential elements including fmgen/fm_acc[27:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\dr.chernobyl\desktop\lab3\lab3\source\tonegen.vhd":200:1:200:2|Found inferred clock sviraj|clk_25m which controls 348 sequential elements including I_tonegen/R_vol[16:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
