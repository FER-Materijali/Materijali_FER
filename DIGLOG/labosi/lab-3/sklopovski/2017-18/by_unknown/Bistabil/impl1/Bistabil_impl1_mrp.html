    INFO: Design contains pre-loadable EBR during configuration that has a
         requirement:
    Since the GSR is disabled for the EBR, make sure write enable and chip
    enable are inactive during wake-up, so that the pre-loaded initialization
    values will not be corrupted during wake-up state.

---------

GSR Component:
   The local reset signal 'un2_r_0_a2' of the design has been inferred as Global
        Set Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR control is 'un2_r_0_a2'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
