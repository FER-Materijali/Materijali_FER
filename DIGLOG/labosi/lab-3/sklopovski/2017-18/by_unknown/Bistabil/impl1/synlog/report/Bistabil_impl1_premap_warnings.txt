@W: MT531 :"d:\ivan\faks\1. semestar\diglog\lv3\bistabil\impl1\source\pogodi_bistabil.vhd":59:5:59:8|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 1 sequential elements including q[0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"d:\ivan\faks\1. semestar\diglog\lv3\bistabil\impl1\source\pogodi_bistabil.vhd":132:5:132:6|Found inferred clock pogodi_bistabil|btn_center which controls 2 sequential elements including q[5]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
