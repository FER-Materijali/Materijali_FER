WARNING - par: The input signal "clk_25m_c" of PLL instance "I12/PLLInst_0" may not be able to use the dedicated CLKI input pin; therefore, general routing may need to be used for this signal.
The following 1 signal is selected to use the primary clock routing resources:
    I12.clk_pll (driver: I12/PLLInst_0, clk load #: 70)

No signal is selected as DCS clock.

No signal is selected as secondary clock.

No signal is selected as Global Set/Reset.

*****************************************************************
Info: NBR allows conflicts(one node used by more than one signal)
      in the earlier iterations. In each iteration, it tries to  
      solve the conflicts while keeping the critical connections 
      routed as short as possible. The routing process is said to
      be completed when no conflicts exist and all connections   
      are routed.                                                
Note: NBR uses a different method to calculate timing slacks. The
      worst slack and total negative slack may not be the same as
      that in TRCE report. You should always run TRCE to verify  
      your design.
