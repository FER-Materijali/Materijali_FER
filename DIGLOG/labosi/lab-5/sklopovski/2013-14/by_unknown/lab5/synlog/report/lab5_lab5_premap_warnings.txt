@W: MT529 :"c:\users\dr.chernobyl\desktop\lab5\modulator.vhd":41:1:41:2|Found inferred clock afsk_modem|clk_25m which controls 130 sequential elements including modulator/br[31:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
